I like to build a .vim dirtory for the vim set running on my all platform including windows,mac,linux(ubuntu e.g.)

I tested them on my win7 , macbookpro and virtualbox ubuntu

The list:

plugin: zencoding , matchit , vimim (vimim_wubijd.txt 极点五笔输入法词库)

colorscheme:molokai

.vimrc file





How do I using this?

git clone the repo,move the .vimrc file to the ../ , then just make some changes through the different of all platform . then , You can use it.
I think it's nice.






Notes:

something in the .vimrc may need to change,they are:
1. zencoding (the short cut)
2. guifont (font & fontsize)



this .vimrc using the monaco font, may you like it. I like this font very much.


in the .vimrc file , I using the \n to distinguish some contents in my order.


the .vimrc setting based on my mac bookpro. This meaning other platform using this may make some changes like saied in the up paragrph.
