I like to build a .vim dirtory for the vim set running on my all platform including windows,mac,linux(ubuntu e.g.)

I tested them on my win7 , macbookpro and virtualbox ubuntu

The list:

plugin: zencoding , matchit , vimim (vimim_wubijd.txt 极点五笔输入法词库)

colorscheme:molokai

.vimrc file





How do I using this?

git clone the repo,move the .vimrc file to the ../ , then just make some changes through the different of all platform . then , You can use it.
I think it's nice.






Notes:

something in the .vimrc may need to change,they are:
1. zencoding (the short cut)
2. guifont (font & fontsize)
