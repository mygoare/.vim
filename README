I like to build a .vim dirtory for the vim set running on my all platform including windows,mac,linux(ubuntu e.g.)

I tested them on my win7 , macbookpro and virtualbox ubuntu

The list:

plugin: zencoding matchit

colorscheme:molokai

.vimrc file


How do I using this?

git clone the repo,move the .vimrc file to the ../ , then just make some changes through the different of all platform . then , You can use it.
I think it's nice.
